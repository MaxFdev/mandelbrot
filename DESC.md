The Mandelbrot Set Generator is a multithreaded C program designed to compute and visualize the Mandelbrot set with high efficiency. By leveraging multiple engine threads, it rapidly calculates pixel values for large images, producing a BMP file that represents the fractalâ€™s intricate patterns. Users can customize the image size, zoom level, and position in the complex plane, enabling both broad overviews and detailed explorations of the set. This project demonstrates advanced concurrency techniques and low-level image generation, making it a practical example of parallel programming and mathematical visualization.
