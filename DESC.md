The Mandelbrot Set Generator is a multithreaded C program designed to compute and visualize the Mandelbrot set with high efficiency. It uses multiple engine threads to calculate pixel values for large images, producing a BMP file that represents the fractalâ€™s intricate patterns. Users can customize the image size, zoom level, and position in the complex plane. This project demonstrates how concurrency techniques and image generation can be used to enhance parallel programming and mathematical visualization.
